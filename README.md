Trajectorix
##Project Overview
**Trajectorix** is an advanced platform designed to monitor and predict the trajectories of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using NASA’s open datasets and machine learning. The system provides a real-time, user-friendly dashboard that visualizes asteroid orbits, classifies collision risks, and delivers educational content to raise public awareness about planetary defense. By leveraging NASA’s NEO data and AI-driven analytics, this project aims to enhance our understanding of asteroid threats and support global efforts to protect Earth.

##Objectives
* Develop a machine learning model to classify asteroids by risk level (low, medium, high) based on size, velocity, and close-approach distance.
* Create an interactive 3D dashboard to visualize asteroid orbits and potential Earth impacts.
* Provide real-time updates and alerts for newly detected NEOs using NASA’s APIs.
* Educate the public through shareable infographics and insights derived from social media (e.g., X posts) about asteroid events.
