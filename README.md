# WildFire WatchDog

## Project Overview
**Wildfire Watchdog** is a real-time wildfire monitoring and response platform that leverages NASA’s satellite data to track fire outbreaks, predict spread, and suggest evacuation routes. The tool provides an interactive web or mobile interface with maps, fire intensity metrics, and community alerts, empowering first responders and residents to mitigate wildfire impacts. By integrating NASA’s Earth observation data with geospatial analytics, this project addresses the growing global threat of wildfires driven by climate change.

## Objectives
* Develop an interactive map to display real-time wildfire hotspots using NASA’s FIRMS data.
* Predict fire spread using weather and terrain data to identify at-risk areas.
* Calculate safe evacuation routes based on fire progression and local geography.
* Deliver alerts to users in affected regions via a user-friendly interface.
